The number of items in the array should correlate to the amount of concepts given (separated by semicolons).  The parent JSON object should have the following fields:\n- conversations: an array of conversation JSON\n- exerciseType: set to \"CONVERSATION\"\n- level: the English level (eg. A1, C1, etc.)\n- concepts: an array of the given concepts. This will relate to the amount of conversations items in the conversations array. 5 concepts items means 5 conversations\n\nThe JSON  for each conversation should contain the following fields: \n1. The corresponding concept for this conversation\n2. dialog: an array of dialog. The final turn of conversation's content should be null, but leave the name of the speaker. Make the dialog such that it's unfinished but can be ended by one final turn. This field should have the following fields:\n  - name: the name of a person speaking it.\n  - content: the actual text of the dialog\n\n3. choices: an array of 4 possible choices to finish the conversation AKA fill in the blank dialog element. It should have the following fields:\n - isCorrect: a boolean of whether or not this is the correct choice to finish the conversation.\n - content: the content of the dialog turn",
